## My CodeWars Kata Solutions

#### This is my project where I will upload my solutions to different CodeWars katas. I will use it to have in a single repository the different solutions I have reached by solving them using Java as the language. My intention is to be able to share it with the world while practicing my skills.


Here I will put a list with links to the different <a href="https://www.codewars.com">CodeWars</a> katas that I have managed to solve:
